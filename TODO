TODO LIST

- [X] Finish spatial modeling (connections remaining)
- [X] Observe changes with reasonable data (tweak data in config.py until good behaviour)
- [X] Analyze the behaviour of SNN in NEST
- [ ] Analyze the steady states (?)
- [Piuomenofatta] Comparison between the two models
- [X] Results
- [X] Many many graphs
- [ ] Report

MORE STUFF

- [ ] Graph showing the connection range of a Neuron (guardare ultima parte di prova.ipynb per esempio)
- [ ] Compare the connection range graphs of the two Models
- [ ] Compare the architectures with different parameters (tipo cambiare il rate del mf, cambiare il peso delle connessioni ...)
- [ ] Make a more explainable Voltage analysis (Spectral Analysis)
- [ ] MOST IMPORTANTLY: For all the parameters varying with distance, handle the limit cases
- [ ] In the spatially structured network, show how some connections are more impactful than others
